# OrganSampler - rules for every session (Windows and Linux)

The user writes Czech; answer in Czech; append a closing report to `OrganSampler/CLAUDE_REPORTS.md`
(the copy on the NTFS disk: `F:\JUCE_PROJEKTY\OrganSamplerC` = `/mnt/pracovni/JUCE_PROJEKTY/OrganSamplerC`).

## Icons - do not touch without asking
- The icon set is one per size and lives in git: `OrganSampler/Source/Icons/icon-{16,24,32,48,64,128,256}.png`
  (16-128 hand-tuned: outlines, the smallest with thick pipes; 256 the picture), `OrganSampler/Source/AppIcon.png`
  (1024, the website picture), `OrganSampler/OrganSampler_icon.ico` (all seven sizes, PNG entries),
  `OrganSampler/Source/Icons/OrganSampler.icns` (sixteen entries: the classic RLE types is32/il32/ih32/it32 with
  their masks for 16/32/48/128 - the Finder of macOS 10.7-10.13 shows PNG data in `icp4`/`icp5` as pixel garbage,
  so those two are never written - and PNG ic07-ic14 for 128-1024 and the @2x sizes; built by
  `python OrganSampler/Tools/make_icns.py OrganSampler/Source/Icons OrganSampler/Source/AppIcon.png
  OrganSampler/Source/Icons/OrganSampler.icns` from icon-16..512.png + AppIcon.png), `site/assets/icon.png` (= AppIcon).
- JUCE (CMake and Projucer alike) would rescale two of them into blurred icons: `CMakeLists.txt` overwrites JUCE's
  generated `icon.ico` / `AppIcon.icns` with ours after `juce_add_gui_app`; the jucer's VS exporter copies the .ico
  by `postExportShellCommandWin`, which `Projucer --resave` does NOT run - after a resave on Windows copy
  `OrganSampler/OrganSampler_icon.ico` over `OrganSampler/Builds/VisualStudio2026/icon.ico` by hand.
- Never replace the icons by a rescaled or "improved" set. If a picture changes, rebuild the 256/1024 entries
  only and keep 16-128 as they are. Linux (menu entry, window icon) uses the same files.

## Versions and releases
- Every delivered build is a new version. Bump it in ALL of: `OrganSampler/OrganSampler.jucer` (`version=`),
  `CMakeLists.txt` (`project(... VERSION ...)`), `site/config.js` (`version:` - app.js writes it into the page),
  `site/index.html` (`data-version` spans), `configurations/rural-organ/README.md` ("Saved with OrganSampler ..."),
  `OrganSampler/CHANGELOG.md`. Before tagging, grep the previous version string over the repo (CHANGELOG excepted).
- Regenerate `OrganSampler/Source/ManualData.h` after any manual edit: `python OrganSampler/Tools/generate_manual_data.py`.
- Commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`, push, tag `v<version>`; CI builds Windows,
  macOS (Apple silicon, macOS 11+), Intel macOS 10.11+ and Linux and publishes a pre-release; the release job deletes
  every older `v*` release and tag. The Rural Organ demo release `rural-organ-0.8` stays. Only Sonus Paradisi is ever
  named for samples; never "sample set" - say sample folders / folder tree.
- Windows commit messages: write the message to a file WITHOUT BOM (`[IO.File]::WriteAllText(path, text)`) and
  `git commit -F <file>`; `-F -` with a here-string does not work in PowerShell 5.1 (the text becomes pathspecs,
  the commit fails and a following `git tag` lands on the previous commit), and `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` adds
  a BOM to the subject line. Tag only after `git log -1` shows the new commit.
- Windows: `git` is not on PATH - use Visual Studio's
  (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\...\Team Explorer\Git\cmd\git.exe`); after pulling,
  run `C:\JUCE9\Projucer.exe --resave OrganSampler\OrganSampler.jucer` and copy the .ico (above), commit the regenerated
  `Builds/VisualStudio2026` and `JuceLibraryCode`. Linux clone: `~/OrganSamplerC-linux` (git cannot run on the NTFS
  checkout from Linux); Linux builds come from CI only, the binary goes to `~/Downloads/OrganSampler` by rename.

## Configurations and paths
- A configuration never stores an absolute path except a tree outside the sample library root (another disk);
  everything under the root is relative to it (`sampleLibraryRootName` / `sampleLibraryRootRelative`, pool
  `sampleTrees`, `folderRelativePath`, `extraFolderRelativePaths`, `reverbIrRelative`/`reverbIrLibraryRelative`).
  A portable configuration carries no machine settings: devices become `deviceType="default"` with the route's
  sample rate and buffer size; "none" stays none.
- Never alter audio silently; never drop user-configured content (routes, stops, folders) without asking first
  (AskUserQuestion). A row of the Stop List is never removed by the program itself - only by the user
  ("Remove empty stops", arrange mode).
- Stop folders (a container stop with indented children) are table rows: the container has no folders, the
  children `child: true`. Keep them through every save/load path.
- Transmissions grouped under a stop folder are NOT table rows: they live in the source stop's voicing entry
  (`voicingSettings.stops[].transmissions[]` with `groupMaster`). Search there before claiming they are gone.
- The transmission list of a stop belongs to the Stop List / voicing state only. A combination, crescendo step
  or registration sets on/off states and must never replace, add to or remove from the list (0.8.92).
- The voicing state keeps entries of stops the engine could not build (missing folders) and writes them back;
  never let a save drop voicing of a stop that merely failed to load.

## Testing
- Windows delivery: after every release build copy the exe to `C:\OrganSampler\OrganSampler_<version>.exe`
  (the local MSBuild Release build or the CI exe) and point the desktop shortcut
  `OrganSampler_<version>.exe – zástupce.lnk` at it (rename the previous version's shortcut; WScript.Shell
  CreateShortcut, TargetPath + IconLocation). The user starts the program from that shortcut.
- Never build or launch the program while the user runs it. Linux test: `~/tools/linux_test.sh <exe> <seconds>`
  with `CFG=`, `ORGAN_OPEN_STOP_LIST=`, `ORGAN_JACK_BUFFER=`, `ORGAN_SAVE_PORTABLE=` hooks; the activity log is
  `~/.config/OrganSampler/CrashLogs/activity.log` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\OrganSampler\CrashLogs\activity.log`).
